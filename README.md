## User Stories
### MVP Goals
- As a user, I would like to see my stock holdings and portfolio balance.
- As a user, I would like to see information on the daily change in stock price with the option to click for more details on a given stock in my portfolio.
- As a user, I want to be able to search for information on stocks (whether or not they exist in my portfolio).

### Stretch Goals
- As a user, I want to be able to track the purchase and sale of stocks in my portfolio and see a cash balance that reflects these purchases/sales.
- As a user I would like to have the option to watch stocks I have saved as favorites.
 
## Hurdles
- Asynchronous API data
- Using an API link with dynamic variables
- Bootstrap vs React Bootstrap
